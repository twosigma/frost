# Store Queue

Commit-ordered store buffer that holds in-flight store instructions from dispatch
until they write to memory after ROB commit. Entries are allocated in program order
and freed when their memory write completes.

## Architecture

```
  Dispatch ──> [Alloc] ──> Tail
                              |
  MEM_RS Issue ──> [Addr Update] ──> CAM search by rob_tag
               ──> [Data Update] ──> CAM search by rob_tag
                              |
  ROB Commit ──> [Commit Mark] ──> CAM search by rob_tag
                              |
  [Memory Write] ──> Head (committed + addr_valid + data_valid)
      |                   |
  [FSD Phase 0]     [FSD Phase 1]
      |                   |
  [Write Done] ──> Free entry, advance head
      |
  [L0 Cache Invalidate] ──> to LQ
```

**Forwarding to Load Queue (combinational):**

```
  LQ ──> [SQ Check: addr, rob_tag, size]
                    |
  SQ ──> scan all older entries
      |           |
  [all_older_addrs_known]  [newest matching store]
                    |
              [can_forward?]
                    |
  SQ ──> [Forward Result: match, can_forward, data] ──> LQ
```

## Storage Strategy

All fields in FFs (not LUTRAM/BRAM). 8 entries at ~115 bits each (~920 bits
total). Rationale:

- **CAM-style tag search**: Address/data update and commit must find matching
  `rob_tag` across all entries in parallel.
- **Per-entry invalidation**: Partial flush must clear individual uncommitted
  entries by age comparison in a single cycle.
- **Parallel scan**: Forwarding reads all entries to find matching stores.
- **8 entries**: Too small for BRAM, marginal for LUTRAM.

## Entry Structure

| Field       | Width   | Description                              |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| valid       | 1 bit   | Entry allocated                          |
| rob_tag     | 5 bits  | ROB entry for this store                 |
| is_fp       | 1 bit   | FP store (FSW/FSD)                       |
| addr_valid  | 1 bit   | Address has been calculated              |
| address     | 32 bits | Store address                            |
| data_valid  | 1 bit   | Data is available                        |
| data        | 64 bits | Store data (FLEN for FSD)                |
| size        | 2 bits  | 00=B, 01=H, 10=W, 11=D (for FSD)         |
| is_mmio     | 1 bit   | MMIO address (bypass cache on commit)    |
| fp64_phase  | 1 bit   | FSD phase: 0=low word, 1=high word       |
| committed   | 1 bit   | ROB has committed this store             |
| sent        | 1 bit   | Written to memory                        |
| **Total**   | **~115 bits** |                                    |

## Key Behaviors

1. **Allocation**: On `i_alloc.valid && !o_full`, write entry at tail, advance
   tail pointer.

2. **Address Update**: CAM search all entries for matching `rob_tag` with
   `!addr_valid`. Write address and `is_mmio` flag.

3. **Data Update**: CAM search all entries for matching `rob_tag` with
   `!data_valid`. Write store data (FLEN-wide).

4. **Commit**: When ROB commits a store (`i_commit_valid`), CAM search for
   matching `rob_tag` and set `committed = 1`.

5. **Memory Write**: Head entry writes to memory when `committed && addr_valid
   && data_valid && !sent`. Single outstanding write. Byte enables generated
   from size and address offset.

6. **FSD Two-Phase**: Phase 0 writes low word (addr), phase 1 writes high word
   (addr+4). Both must complete before entry is freed.

7. **Store-to-Load Forwarding**: Combinational scan of all entries. For each
   valid entry older than the load: check addr_valid for disambiguation, check
   address overlap for matching. Forward when exact address match, same size,
   WORD/DOUBLE, and data_valid.

8. **L0 Cache Invalidation**: On memory write completion, output the written
   address to the LQ's L0 cache for invalidation.

9. **Flush**: `i_flush_all` resets all state. `i_flush_en` invalidates
   uncommitted entries younger than `i_flush_tag`. Committed entries are never
   flushed (they must complete to memory).

## Verification

- **Formal**: `ifdef FORMAL` block with BMC (depth 12) and cover (depth 20).
  Assertions check pointer/count consistency, memory write prerequisites,
  forwarding invariants, committed-survives-flush, and reset behavior.
- **Cocotb**: Unit tests covering reset, allocation, address/data update,
  commit + memory write (SW/SH/SB), FSD two-phase, FSW, store-to-load
  forwarding, MMIO, flush, and constrained random.
